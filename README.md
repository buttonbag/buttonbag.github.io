The purpose of this page is to showcase all my completed github projects.

1. Starting with main page, link to already completed github projects. Resume page is a good start.
1. Also, content first approach is a good way to get it done quickly and acts as a roadmap.
1. revisit old tutorial projects and see it to completion.
1. complete two simple projects and add to it.
